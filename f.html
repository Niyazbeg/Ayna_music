        <h1>Form</h1>
        <p><strong>Form 5 introduces a number of input tags that can be represented by other interface elements. Some are based upon text input fields and are intended to input and validate specific common data. These include email to enter email addresses, tel for telephone numbers, number for numeric values. There are additional attributes to specify required fields, fields that should have keyboard focus when the web page containing the form is loaded, and placeholder text that is displayed within the field but is not user input (such as the 'Search' text displayed in many search input fields before a search term is entered.) These tasks used to be handled with JavaScript, but had become so common that support for them was added to the standard. The date input type displays a calendar from which the user can select a date or date range.[2][3] And the color input type can be represented as an input text simply checking the value entered is a correct hexadecimal representation of a color, according to the specification,[4] or a color picker widget (the latter being the solution used in most browsers which support this attribute).</strong></p>
